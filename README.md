## 📌 Project Idea

This project is a 3D design of a robotic arm using Tinkercad.  
It features *5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF)* and simulates the motion and structure of real industrial robotic arms used in automation and manufacturing.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice 3D design using Tinkercad  
- Understand robotic arm components and structure  
- Simulate the motion using joints and links  
- Develop alignment and modeling accuracy

## 🧩 Design Components

| Part              | Quantity | Description                      |
|-------------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Base Cylinder     | 1        | Rotating base of the arm         |
| Joint Cylinders   | 5        | Rotational joints between links  |
| Arm Links         | 5        | Connects joints together         |
| Gripper (Claw)    | 1        | End effector to grip objects     |

Used tools in Tinkercad:
- *Align Tool* for centering parts  
- *Rotate & Move Tools* for orientation  
- *Group/Ungroup* for combining shapes
